# OSDA_BHW

Check the following notebooks for the results:
* `experiments_heart.ipynb` - model performance on a dataset with heart diseases.
* `experiments_water.ipynb` - model performance on a dataset with safe water detection.
* `experiments_weather.ipynb` - model performance on a dataset with weather predictions.

To deal with numeric values I used binarization of features. Neural FCA does not show good results on the following datasets.

Accuracy metric values are available either inside `*.ipynb` files, or as `*.csv` files in `/metrics`
