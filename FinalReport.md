## Datasets

I used the following datasets in the project:

### Heart failure prediction

* `Weather prediction` - [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

The dataset I used is a small part of a big dataset, which could be found at the link. It contains different weather conditions, which could be used to predict the weather.
